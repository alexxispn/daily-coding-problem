ℹ️ **Kata Description**

There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps at a time.
Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.

For example, if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways:
```
1, 1, 1, 1
2, 1, 1
1, 2, 1
1, 1, 2
2, 2
```
Hint: Try preprocessing the dictionary into a more efficient data structure to speed up queries.
